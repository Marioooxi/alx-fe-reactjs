# React Query Demo

This project demonstrates how to use **React Query** to fetch, cache, and update data in a React application. It fetches posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and displays them in a list.

## Features
- **Data Fetching**: Uses React Query's `useQuery` hook to fetch data.
- **Caching**: Automatically caches data to reduce unnecessary API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if the request fails.
- **Manual Refetching**: Includes a button to manually refetch data.
